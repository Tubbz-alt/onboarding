# Onboarding Developers

This is intended as a quick tutorial and reference guide for new developers
who are solid with go, but want to get up to speed quickluy with SDK programming.
We are focusing here mainly on how to build modules, as that is the majority of
the blockchain work at Regen.

## Module strucutre

As of cosmos-sdk 0.36, all new modules are supposed to follow the
[following structure](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/building-modules/structure.md).
I will go through step-by-step as I build out a new module based on existing code, to demonstrate how to
create this.

Check out the [step by step guide](./module_layout.md) if you are interested in the details.
